### PerfBoost Settings

A configuration addon for the perf_boost.dll mod https://github.com/pepopo978/perf_boost that provides an easy-to-use interface for adjusting performance optimization settings.

### [Guide for new users](GUIDE.md)

## Settings

### Master Control
- **Enable Performance Boost** - Enable/disable all performance boost features

<b>You can keybind this in your keybinds â€” I highly recommend doing this in case you need to see hidden units in an emergency!<b>

### Rendering Settings
- **Always Render Raid Marks** - Whether to always render raid marks regardless of distance/combat/etc
- **Always Render Players** - Comma-separated list of player names to always render regardless of other settings
- **Never Render Players** - Comma-separated list of player names to never render regardless of other settings
- **Hide All Players** - Hide all players regardless of other render settings

**Note:** The addon will scan for players in your always/never render lists once per minute to cache their GUIDs. For better performance, it's recommended to clear out old names from these lists when players are no longer relevant.

### Player Render Distance
- **Default Player Render Distance** - Max distance to render players when not in combat or cities (-1 to disable, 0-100 yards)
- **In Combat Player Render Distance** - Max distance to render players when in combat (-1 to disable, 0-100 yards)

### Unit Render Distance
- **Default Trash Unit Render Distance** - Max distance to render trash units (level < 63) when not in combat (-1 to disable, 0-100 yards)

### Spell Visual Settings
- **Show Other Player Spell Visuals** - Whether to show spell visual effects from other players (spell casts, ranged weapon projectiles, wanding, etc.)
- **Show Other Player Ground Effects** - Whether to show ground effects from players
- **Show Other Player Aura Visuals** - Whether to show aura visual effects on players

- **Hide Spells for Hidden Players** - Hide spell visuals from players that are hidden due to render distance or other settings
- **Always Hidden Spell IDs** - Comma-separated list of spell IDs to hide visuals for (e.g., 1234,5678)
- **Always Shown Spell IDs** - Comma-separated list of spell IDs to always show visuals for, overriding other settings

### Event Filtering
- **Filter GUID Events** - Filters out generally unnecessary superwow GUID-based events to reduce event spam and improve performance. Blocks events like UNIT_AURA, UNIT_HEALTH, UNIT_MANA when triggered with a guid instead of a string like 'player' or 'raid1', while preserving commonly used guid events like UNIT_COMBAT and UNIT_MODEL_CHANGED.

## Distance Priority

The addon will prioritize render distances in the following order:
1. **Combat Distance** - Used when in combat (highest priority)
2. **City Distance** - Used when in cities (for players only)
3. **Default Distance** - Used in all other situations (lowest priority)
