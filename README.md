### PerfBoost Settings

A configuration addon for the perf_boost.dll mod https://github.com/pepopo978/perf_boost that provides an easy-to-use interface for adjusting performance optimization settings.

## Settings

### Master Control
- **Enable Performance Boost** - Enable/disable all performance boost features

<b>You can keybind this in your keybinds â€” I highly recommend doing this in case you need to see hidden units in an emergency!<b>

### Rendering Settings
- **Always Render Raid Marks** - Whether to always render raid marks regardless of distance/combat/etc
- **Always Render Players** - Comma-separated list of player names to always render regardless of other settings
- **Never Render Players** - Comma-separated list of player names to never render regardless of other settings
- **Hide All Players** - Hide all players regardless of other render settings

**Note:** The addon will scan for players in your always/never render lists once per minute to cache their GUIDs. For better performance, it's recommended to clear out old names from these lists when players are no longer relevant.

### Player Render Distance
- **Default Player Render Distance** - Max distance to render players when not in combat or cities (-1 to disable, 0-100 yards)

## Distance Priority

The addon will prioritize render distances in the following order:
1. **Combat Distance** - Used when in combat (highest priority)
2. **City Distance** - Used when in cities (for players only)
3. **Default Distance** - Used in all other situations (lowest priority)
